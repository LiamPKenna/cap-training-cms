# _Project Planning_

Name of Project: CAP Training CMS

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?):
The app will provide a platform for any educational materials. Admin users will be able to add courses/quizzes without any programming knowledge and track student progress through the materials.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
Admin dashboard
Lesson creation view
Student views

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

My plan is to use:
React
Redux
Firebase

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

My main stretch goal beyond adding additional content management functionality is to potentially mirror the student views in React Native (big stretch). I would also like to build a client facing "Buy my app!" site. That is likely a more realistic stretch goal.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

React Native
Ruby/Rails for client site
